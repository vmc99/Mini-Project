# Unmasking Human Faces - Project
---
The objective of this work is to remove mask objects in facial images. We break the problem into two stages: **mask object detection** and **image completion** of the removed mask region.

## Overview :pencil2:
![image](images/Overview.jpg)

## Mask Object Detection and Segmentation - Part 1 :mask:
---
- For this task we used Mask RCNN to detect the object (facemask) and generate binary segmentation maps and implemented this model using **detectron2**

## Image Completion - Part 2  üé≠ üöß (in progress)
---

- The goal of this model is to remove the mask and complete the left behind region in a way that is both structural and appearance wise consistent with the ground truth image.

- For this task, We are going through some state-of-the-art architectures such as **GAN** (generative adversarial network), autoencoders etc.

    *We are currently working on this to find the best architecture for this task (facial inpainting)*
